            <h5 class="card-title">Session storage</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              Session storage is a read-only property who accesses a session Storage object for the current origin. Session storage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in
              localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Local storage</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              Local storage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist
              even after the browser window is closed.

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Global Scope</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              Variables declared Globally (outside of any function) have Global Scope and Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a program. Similar to function scope variables declared with
              var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Block Scope</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              Block scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block
              scoped. In order to access the variables of that specific block, we need to create an object for it. Variables declared with the var keyword, do not have block scope.

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Event Loop</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
              The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion
              of multi-threading. Let's take a look at what happens on the back-end. <br />
              The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack. <br />
              The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should
              be sent for execution.<br />
              Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own
              single-threaded operation.

              III. If we do not pass a parameter into a function.<br />
              IV. If there is nothing on the right side of return of a function.<br />
              V. When there is no value inside a object.<br />
              VI. When we console an empty array.<br />
              VII. When we delete array[1], it will create a whole in that array.<br />
              VIII. We cannot set a undefined variable.<br />
